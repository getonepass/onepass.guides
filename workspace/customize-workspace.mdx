# Get your Workspace Ready with OnePass Bridge

Your company workspace is the central hub for all your activities on OnePass Bridge. It is where you can manage your organization profile, data room, deal flow, and credentials. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up and customize your workspace effectively.

## Why Customize Your Workspace?

Investing a few minutes to set up your profile will:

- make it easier to manage your activity within the OnePass and integrate it in your own external workflows and communication,  
- allow you adding colleagues to share specific tasks or manage jointly your activity, and  
- create a seamless experience in your interactions with other users (startups, investors, funding operators).  

## Steps to Customize Your OnePass Profile

<Steps>

### Keeps your Branding Updated  

Adding the logo and the high-concept pitch to your workspace will make your company more recognizable  (e.g. when listed in the search results) and will help you to stand out in the OnePass ecosystem. Make sure that the image you upload has enough quality and that it follows size and format suggestions, do that it will be displayed correctly in all the different contexts.
The logo of your workspace is already requested during onboarding, but you add it or change it at any point from your workspace settings (and also from your company profile).

### Invite your Team Members to the Workspace

You can add team members to your workspace at any time. You can assign them different roles based on their responsibilities: from managing all features of the workspace (as an administrator) to having limited access to a restricted set of projects with limited features. You can also remove them from your workspace at any time.

### Generate Access Tokens for your APIs

The access tokens allows extending the functionality of OnePass to your needs and enable you to build custom solutions (such as automated worklows) by providing a secure way to authenticate API requests.  

### Include Sender Identities to customize your communication

You can add and manage your sender identities to send and receive emails through our platform to ensure a seamless email experience. Send messages from OnePass but show to recipient the same name and email account you use in your regular comms. Define in which account you wnat to receive responses and which of your sender identities will be the one used by default.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  

### Can I change the name of my workspace?  

The name and type of your workspace are assigned at the moment of creating your profile during the onboarding and cannot be changed.  

### Is it possible to belong to more than one workspace?  

Each user can create or belong to multiple workspaces with similar or different roles (e.g. you can be the workspace owner of your own startup and a team member of a company where you work part-time). You can switch between them at any time from the top right corner of the screen.
