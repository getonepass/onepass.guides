# How OnePass Bridge Implements and Uses Verifiable Credentials

OnePass Bridge is revolutionizing the way startups and investors connect by leveraging **verifiable credentials (VCs)**, a key component of decentralized identity technology. This guide explains how OnePass Bridge uses VCs to enhance trust, security, and efficiency in the fundraising and investment process.  

## What Are Verifiable Credentials?

Verifiable credentials are digital attestations issued by trusted entities that can be cryptographically verified by another party. They enable secure, tamper-proof proof of identity, qualifications, or other attributes without relying on centralized databases.  

### Key Components of Verifiable Credentials

- **Issuer:** The entity that creates and signs the credential (e.g., a university, government agency, or financial institution).  
- **Holder:** The individual or entity that receives and stores the credential (e.g., a startup or investor).  
- **Verifier:** The entity that checks the authenticity and validity of the credential (e.g., an investor or startup).  

## How OnePass Bridge Uses Verifiable Credentials

### 1. Startup Verification

- **Legal Identity:** Startups can issue verifiable credentials to prove their legal identity, such as business registration certificates or incorporation documents.  
- **Financial Health:** Financial statements and audit reports can be issued as verifiable credentials, ensuring they are accurate and tamper-proof.  
- **Team Credentials:** Founders and team members can share verifiable credentials for academic qualifications, professional certifications, or work experience.  

### 2. Investor Verification

- **Accreditation Status:** Investors can issue verifiable credentials to prove their accreditation status or compliance with regulatory requirements.  
- **Fund Details:** Verifiable credentials can be used to share fund term sheets, memorandums, or track records.  
- **Identity Verification:** Investors can prove their identity using verifiable credentials, ensuring transparency and trust.  

### 3. Secure Document Sharing

- **Verified Documents:** Startups and investors can share verified documents (e.g., pitch decks, financial statements) as verifiable credentials, ensuring their authenticity.  
- **Selective Disclosure:** Share only the necessary details from a document without revealing unnecessary personal data.  

### 4. Trusted Interactions

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Verify specific attributes (e.g., revenue, age) without disclosing the underlying data, ensuring privacy while maintaining trust.  
- **Tamper-Proof Records:** All interactions and transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### Step 3: Verification

- The receiving party (e.g., an investor or startup) verifies the credential using cryptographic proof.  
- Verification is instant and does not require contacting the issuer.  

### Step 4: Collaboration

- Once verified, startups and investors can collaborate securely, knowing that all shared information is accurate and trustworthy.  

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Startup Fundraising

- A startup shares verifiable credentials for its legal identity, financial statements, and team qualifications with potential investors.  
- Investors instantly verify the credentials, reducing the time spent on manual due diligence.  
- The startup builds trust and credibility, increasing its chances of securing funding.  

### Example 2: Investor Accreditation

- An investor shares a verifiable credential proving their accreditation status with a startup.  
- The startup verifies the credential instantly, ensuring the investor meets regulatory requirements.  
- The investor gains access to exclusive investment opportunities.  

### Example 3: Cross-Border Collaboration

- A startup in Europe shares verifiable credentials with an investor in Asia.
