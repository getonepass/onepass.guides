# Presenting Credentials

Presenting a verifiable credential is the process by which a holder shares proof of their credentials with a verifier. This guide will walk you through the steps to present credentials effectively.

## Understanding Credential Presentation

A credential presentation (or verifiable presentation) is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in a way that allows cryptographic verification. It contains one or more verifiable credentials or derived claims that have been issued by a trusted authority.

## Prerequisites

Before presenting credentials, ensure you have:

1. A digital wallet that supports verifiable credentials
2. One or more verifiable credentials stored in your wallet
3. A request from a verifier to present specific credentials

## Steps to Present Credentials

<Steps>
### Receive a Presentation Request

The process typically begins when you receive a presentation request from a verifier. Tipically the request will be in the form of a QR code, a link, or a direct request.
This initiates a presentation request that specifies which credentials or claims they need to verify. The presentation request contains all the necessary parameters for your wallet to understand what information is being requested.

### Select the Appropriate Credentials

In your digital wallet:

- Review the presentation request
- Select the credentials that satisfy the requirements
- Ensure you're comfortable sharing the requested information

### Create the Presentation

Your wallet will:

- Package the selected credentials
- Digitally sign the presentation using your private key
- Format the presentation according to standards (like W3C Verifiable Presentations)

### Share the Presentation

There are several ways to share your presentation:

- QR code scan
- Direct digital transmission
- Upload to a secure portal
- Near-field communication (NFC)

### Verification Process

After you share your presentation:

- The verifier's system will cryptographically validate the signature
- Check that the credentials haven't been revoked
- Verify the issuer's signature on each credential
- Ensure the credentials meet the request requirements
</Steps>

## Privacy Considerations

When presenting credentials, keep these privacy practices in mind:

- Share only the minimum necessary information
- Use selective disclosure when possible
- Understand what data will be stored by the verifier and for how long
- Consider using zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy

## Troubleshooting

Common issues when presenting credentials:

- **Expired credentials**: Ensure your credentials are still valid
- **Connectivity problems**: Check your internet connection
- **Incompatible formats**: Verify the verifier supports your credential format
- **Authentication failures**: Ensure your wallet is properly authenticated

## Advanced Features

Modern credential presentation systems may support:

- Selective disclosure of attributes
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Biometric verification
- Cross-device presentation flows

## Conclusion

Presenting verifiable credentials gives you control over your digital identity while providing verifiers with trusted information. As this technology advances, the process will become increasingly seamless and secure.
