[OnePass Hub](https://getonepass.eu/) offers information about cascade funding opportunities (also known as Financial Support to Third Parties - FSTP-) around specific thematic and technology domains. The focus is on these opportunities because they are usually easier to apply for by SMEs and they support targeted innovation and technology which is closer to market.

However, other opportunities that might be interesting are also covered, such as some call for proposals by Joint Undertakings, incubation and acceleration programmes, expressions of interest, Startup competitions, etc.

Additionally, OnePass Hub will cover soon some training opportunities - supported by the European Commission and, thus, offered at disscounted rates.

## Funding vs. training opportunities

The funding opportunities usually offer financial (commonly implemented as a lump sum), technical and/or business support, linked to the development of a pilot or demostration project, an experiment or a technology solution. These opportunities are usually open to a specific group of applicants fulfilling some eligibility criteria and for activities with an specific purpose.

On the other hand, the training collected is only offering a opportunity to learn something. They maybe individual courses, MOOCS, or short educational programmes organized in group of courses called "Learning pathways". Some of those will be free and some other may have a price. which might be disscounted for those promoted by projects funded or co-funded by the European Commission.
