## Step 1: Create Your Organization Workspace

To get started, you'll first need to register your organization on the OnePass platform:

1. **Sign Up or Log In:**  
   Visit the [OnePass sign-up page](https://app.onepass.com/signup) and create an account. If you already have an account, simply log in.

2. **Create Your Organization Profile:**  
   After logging in, navigate to the Organization Setup section:
   - Click "Create Organization."
   - Enter your organization's name, industry, location, and other requested details.
   - Provide a brief and compelling description of your company, highlighting your key business activities or investment focus.

3. **Verify Your Organization:**  
   OnePass Bridge ensures trust and security through verification:
   - Submit documentation required for the verification process (such as business registration certificates or legal documents).
   - You may be asked to verify your identity or credentials using OnePass Credentials.
   - Once submitted, your organization will undergo a quick review process. Typically, approvals occur promptly, allowing you to start using your workspace without delay.
