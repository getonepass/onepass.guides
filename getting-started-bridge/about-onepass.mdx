# About OnePass Bridge

In a globalized startup ecosystem, establishing meaningful connections between startups and investors across borders can be complex and challenging. Enter **OnePass Bridge**, a dedicated matchmaking solution within the OnePass Platform, designed specifically to simplify and enhance interactions between verified startups and investors worldwide. Here, we explore what OnePass Bridge is, how it works, and the benefits it offers to both startups and investors.

## What is OnePass Bridge?

OnePass Bridge is a specialized startup-investor matchmaking service within the broader OnePass Platform. Leveraging decentralized identity and verifiable credentials technology, it enables secure, seamless, and transparent connections between verified startups and investors across international boundaries.

At its core, OnePass Bridge aims to provide trust and confidence in cross-border startup investments by ensuring all parties have verified credentials and reliable digital identities through the OnePass ecosystem.

## How Does OnePass Bridge Work?

OnePass Bridge operates using **OnePass Credentials**, digital credentials issued and verified within the OnePass Platform. Startups and investors onboarded to the OnePass network receive these credentials, which serve as digital proofs of identity, accreditation, and other critical business attributes.

When engaging within OnePass Bridge:

1. **Verification and Onboarding:**  
   Participants (startups and investors) are onboarded and thoroughly verified through trusted accreditation organizations (TAOs). This ensures reliability, compliance, and trustworthiness of all stakeholders.

2. **Credential Presentation and Verification:**  
   Using OnePass Bridge, startups can securely present their credentials to investors to demonstrate their legitimacy, credibility, and investment readiness. Investors, in turn, present their verification credentials, proving accreditation and readiness to invest.

3. **Matchmaking and Interaction:**  
   Verified startups and investors connect through OnePass Bridge, enabling efficient discovery and meaningful interactions based on verified information and aligned investment interests.
