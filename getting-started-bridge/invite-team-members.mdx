# Invite Team Members to Your Workspace

OnePass makes it easy to collaborate with your team by allowing workspace owners and admins to invite team members and external collaborators. This guide walks you through the process of inviting users, assigning roles, and managing access within your workspace.  

## Who Can Invite Team Members?

- **Workspace Owners:** Full control over the workspace, including inviting and managing members.  
- **Admins:** Can invite and manage members but cannot delete the workspace.  

## Roles and Permissions

### 1. Admin

- **Permissions:**

  - Invite and manage team members.  
  - Edit workspace settings.  
  - Access and manage all projects and documents.  

- **Use Case:** Ideal for team leaders or managers who need full control over the workspace.  

### 2. Team Member

- **Permissions:**

  - Access and contribute to all projects and documents within the workspace.  
  - Cannot invite new members or edit workspace settings.  

- **Use Case:** Ideal for regular team members who need access to shared resources.  

### 3. External Collaborator

- **Permissions:**

  - Access only the specific projects or items they are assigned to.  
  - Cannot view or edit other workspace content.  

- **Use Case:** Ideal for freelancers, contractors, or partners who need limited access to specific projects.
