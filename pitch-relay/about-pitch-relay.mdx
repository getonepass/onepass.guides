# Pitch Relay: Accelerate Your Fundraising Journey

**Pitch Relay** is a powerful OnePass feature that helps startups connect with the right investors effortlessly. Instead of pitching one by one, startups submit a short pitch once, and after approval, it's automatically distributed over time to matching investors eager to fund businesses like yours.

## How Pitch Relay Works for Startups

<Steps>
### Craft Your Quick Pitch

- Submit a short pitch in under **2 minutes**.
- Open to startups worldwide, across all sectors and business models.

### Sit Tight While We Review

- After submission, OnePass **reviews your pitch** for quality and completeness.
- Once approved, your pitch is sent directly to matching investors.
- It remains active for future investor matches as well.

### Meet Your Investor Matches

- Your pitch is distributed to investors **based on industry, stage, location, and funding needs**.
- While not guaranteed, you'll receive **warm introductions** whenever an investor expresses interest.

### Pitch Again in the Future
