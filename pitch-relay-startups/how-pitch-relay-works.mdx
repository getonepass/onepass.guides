# How Pitch Relay Works

Pitch Relay simplifies the fundraising process by automating the connection between startups and investors. This guide explains the step-by-step workflow for both startups and investors, ensuring you understand how to make the most of this powerful feature.  

## Workflow

<Steps>

### Create and Submit Your Pitch

1. Log in to your **OnePass account** and navigate to the **Pitch Relay** section.  
2. Fill out the short pitch form.
3. Submit your pitch for review.  

### Pitch Approval

- Your pitch is reviewed by the OnePass team to ensure it meets quality and relevance standards.  
- Once approved, your pitch is added to the **Pitch Relay network** for distribution.  

### Automatic Distribution

- Your pitch is automatically shared with **investors who match your startupâ€™s profile** based on their investment criteria.  
- It is also added to the **open feed**, where all approved pitches are visible to investors.  

### Track Performance

- Use the **OnePass dashboard** to monitor:  
  - **Views:** How many investors have seen your pitch.  
  - **Matches:** Investors who have expressed interest.  
  - **Connections:** Investors who have requested more information or initiated discussions.  

</Steps>

## Matching Algorithm

Pitch Relay uses a sophisticated matching algorithm to connect startups with the right investors. The algorithm considers:  

- **Startup Profile:** Industry, stage, location, and funding needs.  
- **Investor Criteria:** Preferences for industry, stage, location, and funding range.  

This ensures that startups are matched with investors who are genuinely interested in their business, and investors receive pitches that align with their goals.  


## Key Features of Pitch Relay

- **Single Submission:** Submit your pitch once and reach multiple investors.  
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitor views, matches, and connections in real-time.
