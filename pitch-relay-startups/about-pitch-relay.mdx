# Introduction to Pitch Relay

## What is Pitch Relay?

Pitch Relay is a revolutionary feature within OnePass designed to simplify and streamline the fundraising process for startups while providing investors with a curated deal flow of high-quality opportunities. Instead of startups pitching to investors one by one, they submit a single, well-crafted pitch. Once approved, the pitch is automatically distributed to investors who match the startupâ€™s profile and investment criteria.  

For investors, Pitch Relay offers a **curated deal flow** of startups that align with their interests, as well as an **open feed** to explore all approved pitches. This ensures that both startups and investors can connect efficiently and effectively.
