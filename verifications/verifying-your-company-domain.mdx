# How to Verify Your Company's Domains

Verifying your company's domains on OnePass helps establish trust and authenticity. Verified domains confirm that your organization has control over its official websites, making it more credible for investors and partners. You can verify your primary domain and any additional domains your organization controls.

## Why Verify Your Domains?

- **Enhances trust** by confirming your company's legitimacy across all web properties.
- **Prevents impersonation** and fraudulent activity on all your domains.
- **Displays verification badges** on your company profile for all verified domains, increasing credibility.
- **Establishes connection** between your main domain and subsidiary domains.

## Adding Multiple Domains

OnePass allows you to verify as many domains as your organization controls. This is particularly useful for companies that:

- Operate under different brand names
- Have regional websites (e.g., country-specific domains)
- Maintain separate domains for different products or services
- Recently underwent mergers or acquisitions

## Verification Methods

You can verify each of your company's domains using one of the following methods:

### Email Verification (Recommended)

- A confirmation email is sent to an address using the domain you're verifying (e.g., `you@yourcompany.com`).
- **Steps:**
  1. Go to your **OnePass Account Settings** > **Domain Verification**.
  2. Click on **Add Domain** and enter the domain you want to verify (e.g., `yourcompany.com`).
  3. Choose **Email Verification**.
  4. Select an email address from the provided list (e.g., `admin@yourcompany.com`).
  5. Click **Send Verification Email**.
  6. Check your inbox and click the verification link.
  7. Your domain will be marked as verified once the link is confirmed.
  8. To add more domains, repeat the process by clicking **Add Another Domain**.

### DNS Record Verification

- Requires adding a unique TXT record to each domain's DNS settings.
- **Steps:**
  1. Go to your **OnePass Account Settings** > **Domain Verification**.
  2. Click on **Add Domain**, enter your domain and choose **DNS Verification**.
  3. Copy the provided TXT record.
  4. Log in to your domain provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap).
  5. Navigate to the **DNS settings** and add the TXT record.
  6. Save changes and return to OnePass to click **Verify**.
  7. Verification may take a few minutes to complete.
  8. Repeat for each additional domain you wish to verify.

### Meta Tag Verification

- Requires inserting a unique meta tag into the `<head>` section of each website.
- **Steps:**
  1. Go to your **OnePass Account Settings** > **Domain Verification**.
  2. Click on **Add Domain**, enter your domain and choose **Meta Tag Verification**.
  3. Copy the provided meta tag.
  4. Add it inside the `<head>` section of the website's homepage.
  5. Save changes and return to OnePass to click **Verify**.
  6. The system will scan your site to confirm the tag is present.
  7. Repeat the process for each domain you want to verify.

## Managing Your Verified Domains

- You can remove domains that are no longer relevant to your organization.
- You can designate one domain as your "primary domain" for your organization.
- Each verified domain will display a <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBadgeCheck} size="lg" style={{color: "#6600ff",}} /> **Verified Domain Badge** on your profile.

## After Verification

- Once verified, each domain will be linked to your company profile.
- If verification fails for any domain, ensure you followed the steps correctly and try again.
